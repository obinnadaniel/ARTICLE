In the next aisle, you pass by some cookies and feel a little peckish. You grab one pack. In another section, you find out that there is a ‚ÄúBuy 3 for 2 discount‚Äù. Excited, you buy those items even though you will not eat all of it.

You reach the checkout counter and realize that your bill is higher than you expected. But how could this be? You only bought the necessary stuff, right? You shrug your shoulders and say to yourself ‚ÄúWe have to eat.‚Äù. You pay the bill and go home.

The UAE is famous for its brunches. With unlimited bubbles and delicious dishes, it is no wonder that everybody flocks to them. But if you notice that lately, your budget has been tight and your waist is filling out, then perhaps it is time to ditch the fancy buffets.

Why not spend the weekend organizing a BBQ with your friends and family? Cooking together allows you to purchase in bulk to cook larger portions. Shopping in bulk is a guaranteed saving outlet. Plus, the quality time that you spend together will be just as fulfilling.

The next time you find yourself reaching out for sliced vegetables or diced fruit, ask yourself if this is a necessary
expense. Consumer savings expert, Andrea Woroch, <a class="article__link" href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/78468/7-things-never-buy-grocery-store" target="_blank">
    states</a> that these products can be marked up to as high as 40%. Is it
worth paying for such products when instead, you could spend an extra five minutes on such a simple task?

<p class="article__text">
Choose to buy loose fruits and veg to save money in the long run. On the plus side, loose fruit and veg have a longer
storage life. Nutrients are lost in precut fruit and veg because of <a class="article__link" href="https://www.verywellfit.com/fruits-vegetables-cut-nutrients-lost-2506106" target="_blank">
    heat, oxygen and light</a>. This means that they will

This is something that you may not realize is a contributing factor in draining your budget.
